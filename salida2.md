The blue color of the sky is caused by many chemical reactions between different components of the atmosphere, specifically water vapor and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that come from trees and other plants. The oxygen molecules in the atmosphere absorb some of the blue light that is emitted by the sun, which causes the blue color to appear. Other chemicals like nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide also contribute to the sky's blue hue. These chemical reactions occur at various altitudes in the atmosphere, with low-altitude regions being mostly blue due to high levels of water vapor and volatile organic compounds, while higher altitudes are typically darker due to low water vapor levels and fewer VOCs. The overall effect on the sky is that it appears bluer in areas closer to Earth's surface than farther away, as air at higher altitudes tends to hold more moisture and have lower temperatures.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,338,7254,2861,304,278,14881,1546,6575,4366,322,22233,29879,297,278,8437,29915,29879,25005,2000,278,25005,29889,450,7254,2927,310,278,14744,338,8581,491,1784,22233,19848,29879,1546,1422,7117,310,278,25005,29892,10816,4094,2947,1971,322,1700,24285,2894,293,752,3885,313,24898,29907,29879,29897,393,2041,515,10697,322,916,18577,29889,450,19100,4790,264,13206,21337,297,278,25005,17977,29890,777,310,278,7254,3578,393,338,20076,9446,491,278,6575,29892,607,9946,278,7254,2927,304,2615,29889,5901,22233,29879,763,21767,9102,264,19100,680,322,5394,22613,20562,5389,311,884,29126,304,278,14744,29915,29879,7254,22888,29872,29889,4525,22233,19848,29879,6403,472,5164,5272,20816,297,278,25005,29892,411,4482,29899,1997,4279,12786,1641,11149,7254,2861,304,1880,11174,310,4094,2947,1971,322,1700,24285,2894,293,752,3885,29892,1550,6133,5272,20816,526,12234,6501,261,2861,304,4482,4094,2947,1971,11174,322,28145,478,20166,29879,29889,450,12463,2779,373,278,14744,338,393,372,5692,7254,29878,297,10161,17649,304,11563,29915,29879,7101,1135,26645,3448,29892,408,4799,472,6133,5272,20816,29867,304,4808,901,17478,9161,276,322,505,5224,10430,29879,29889],"total_duration":16215147786,"load_duration":8530070,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":17863000,"eval_count":228,"eval_duration":16142792000}
